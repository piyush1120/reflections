What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you
need to do it?
When I initialize a repository, git creates a .git file on
the same directory in ehich I have tried to create the repository
however, this file remains hidden as it is presided with a dot (.)
Initializing a repository is of vital importance, for without
it the git commands do not operate on the directory/files which
has to be under version-control.
how is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? what value do you think it offers?
Staging are is the intermediate stage between working directory
and repository. A file is added to staging area from the working
directory so that it can be commited to form a repository.
