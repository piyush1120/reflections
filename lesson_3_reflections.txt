When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would definitely use remote when I have more than 1 source of contributor to the
project I am working on. Another reason to commit can be the ease of cloning it into any
local device so that I can work from anywhere with an internet connection. And yet another
reason to use remote repository can be to attract other public contributors and their ideas
if required keeping in mind the confidentiality of the project I am working on.
